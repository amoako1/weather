for i in range (1,11):
    print (i)
    
    # the program prints numbers from 1 to 10
     
    #this is because we tell the compiler to start from 1 andends at 11 with 11 exclusive
    #the range tells the nomber of variables we can work within
    # the i in range refers to the individual variables in the range of variables
